# School-Portfolio
A collection of projects from the days of University, for fond remembrance and easy storage :D

All code is left as-is from the time of submission, although any number of the projects presented
might make for interesting exercises in debugging and optimization. I leave them here unedited for the
casual perusal of any interested individuals, though being school projects one cannot expect them to be
particularly mind-boggling in their complexity or aim. However, they are instructive to certain important
mechanisms of programming that they illustrate, and may on occassion serve as refreshers on said mechanisms,
even for the author himself!

And so, to no one in particular, I wish you happy reading, and perhaps debuggery.
