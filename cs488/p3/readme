Project: #3, Lighting


The object of this assignment was to render a lit scene
depicting at minimum 3 walls and two silver spheres. 
Walls and spheres were rendered using GL_QUADS and 
glutSolidSphere,and lighting and shading were achieved 
using OpenGL's lighting and shading functions, which 
were not expressly forbidden. 

In addition to the above requirements, I have taken the
liberty of adding some camera panning and viewer motion
controls, layed out as such:


Viewer Motion (PRP)
-----------------------*
I: Move Forward  (-Z)  *
K: Move Backward (+Z)  *
J: Move Left     (-X)  *
L: Move Right    (+X)  *
************************
Camera Pan (VRP)        }---> Space Bar: Snap To Origin
-----------------------*
W: Pan Up        (+Y)  *
S: Pan Down      (-Y)  *
A: Pan Left      (-X)  *
D: Pan Right     (+X)  *
************************

These keys are meant to give the viewer some control over 
the scene, allowing them to "walk through" the hall.
