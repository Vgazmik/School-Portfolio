To Build
---------
	$ make -f makef
To Run
---------
	$ ./findit [option 1] [option 2] [option 3] [option 4]

* Items in brackets are optional

* <Options>
    -sum , gives verbose output 
    -acc , displays last access times of files
    -lg  , searches for largest file
    -sm  , searches for smallest file
    -td  , yields graphical representation of directory structure (incomplete)
    -sz  , displays size of files

Summary
---------
findit will parse entered options and prompt the user for a 
pattern to find, which it will then search for starting from 
the location findit is executed. Depending on the options 
entered by the user, findit will also yield various factoids 
about the files it encounters. In the absence of specified
options, output will be minimal. Following it's descent into
the directory structure, findit will report all files 
containing the user-specified pattern, as well as any 
other specified data.

* Note that findit takes simple input, and all options are 
  implicitly &'d
