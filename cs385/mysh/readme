To compile:

$ make -f makeshell

To run:

$ ./mysh

Overview
----------
This shell takes in commands from user input and executes them. Unfortunately 
commands using the '<' and '>' operators have not been made functional, however any valid combination of piped commands may be executed. This shell can also 
traverse the directory structure by means of the 'cd' command, and for reasons
of aesthetics the prompt has been set to the current path followed by '$$'.
If the user enters the command 'stats', all previously executed commands will be listed along with their execution times.

Typical Input Examples
---------------
ls 
ls -1
ls -1 -a
ls | less
ls | grep ma | sort | tail
pwd | grep home 
cd ..
cd /home
