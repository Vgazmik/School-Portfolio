Brief Summary
----------------------------------*
	To compile:
	-----------
		$ make -f makef
	
	To run:
	-------
		$ ./orderSearcher fileName nThreads [gspeed]
	
		* try using light_drops.raw (included!) as fileName...
		* [gspeed] options: -s (slow), -m (medium), 
				    -f (fast), -i(instant)
	
	Objective:
	----------	
		* orderSearcher scans each line of an input 
		  image file and graphs the values of lines
		  better than the curent best with regards 
		  to a given evaluation criteria; presently,
		  only standar deviation is used, and the
		  smaller the deviation, the "better" (order)
	
	Suggestions:
	------------
		* pipe output into less, i.e.

			$ ./orderSearcher fileName nThreads [gspeed] | less
		
		* if you want to stop before finishing, 					
		| you may have latent resources

	A word about rmall:
	-------------------
		* rmall is a simple script posted freely on stackOverflow, 
		  credited to user neverMind
		* When run, it erases all ipc resources in use by the user, 
		  so be careful!
	
		* If not executable:
		
			$ chmod rmall 755
		
		* To run:
		
			$ ./rmall
